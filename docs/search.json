What do these outcomes mean in the context of model uncertainty?\nWhich ensemble modelling approach is most appropriate for climate models given uncertainty in model structure, initial conditions, and RCP scenarios?\nWhat do I mean by “single climate model” in my proposed methods?\nDoes the definition of “single climate model” that I use impact model misspecification? In what ways?\nWhat ARE the consequences of model misspecification associated with selecting a “single climate model” for assessments and forecasts? (since I am trying to mitigate those consequences)\n\nWhat are the disadvantages of the “single assessment model paradigm” vs. avantages of ensemble models?\nHow will I even KNOW that the benefits of ensemble modelling outweight the disadvantages posed by ensemble modelling?\nWhat are the “signs” I should look for in my performance metrics?\nWhat are the management objectives that these metrics are measuring? How much influence does the management objective design have on the performance of the ensemble modelling methods?"
