# Monthly Goals
- Review the Population Dynamics section of the Punt Student reading list
- Prepare the second draft of the Proposal Presentation for my General Exam
- Write code to implement a linear ramp for the phasing in harvest control rule for Ch. 1

# Daily Snapshots

## 20 February 2023

- Created a schedule for the rest of the WIN quarter for meeting my Monthly goals
- Technically a UW holiday today--but did quite a bit to set up to hit the ground running tomorrow  

## 16 February 2023

- Met with AEP to discuss my Ch. 1 question
- Now I will use the average catch for the five previous years to "initialize" the ABC I need from the last management period

## 15 February 2023

- ran 1 simulation using status quo harvest control rule, run 1 simulation using phase-in HCR
- created table in Excel comparing the ABCs for each harvest control rule
  - total catch should be the same
  - how that total catch is distributed should change--did the catch linearly increase or decrease when using phase-in? If yes, good!
- discovered a new question/problem for tomorrow: what is the best way to simulate the ABC from the last management period...for the first simulated management period.
  - tomorrow, I'll just have a status quo assessment go first and then have the phase-in HCR turn on for the next assessment.
- tackled so many email demons today (so many)

## 14 February 2023

- participated in weekly accountability group writing/coding session (Chapter 1)
- revised Ch. 1 phase-in harvest control rule protocol for implementation into ratpackmse software
- implemented new protocol into ratpackmse 

**Happy Valentine's Day**

## 13 February 2023

- travel day (~3 hours waiting for a gate at SEATAC, what a time to be alive)
- studied for General Exam (Population Dynamics section)
- added Masters research summary pages to personal website
- added Towards best practices in selex paper to personal website

## 10 February 2023

- met with weekly accountability group to conduct a retrospective for this week's work and to establish priorities for next week's work
- created a quarto version of my personal website
- created a research notebook section of the website
    - inspired by [Steven Roberts](https://sr320.github.io/)'s lab practices (particularly the work of [Chris Mantegna](https://chrismantegna.github.io/) and [Sarah Tanja](https://sarahtanja.github.io/lab-book/))
