# Monthly Goals
To be added

# Daily Snapshots

## 10 February 2023

- met with weekly accountability group to conduct a retrospective for this week's work and to establish priorities for next week's work
- created a quarto version of my personal website
- created a research notebook section of the website
    - inspired by [Steven Roberts](https://sr320.github.io/)'s lab practices (particularly the work of [Chris Mantegna](https://chrismantegna.github.io/) and [Sarah Tanja](https://sarahtanja.github.io/lab-book/))
