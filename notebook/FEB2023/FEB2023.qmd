# Monthly Goals
- Review the Population Dynamics section of the Punt Student reading list
- Prepare the second draft of the Proposal Presentation for my General Exam
- Write code to implement a linear ramp for the phasing in harvest control rule for Ch. 1

# Daily Snapshots

## 22 February 2023

- Reading [Dormann et al. 2018](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ecm.1309) to continue mapping out the answers to the questions I posed yesterday
  - Looks like I was able to deep dive into the first 6 pages or so: mostly the math behind model averaging and the review of "known properties" of model averaging and quantifying uncertainty
  - Tomorrow is going to be all about methods for estimating model weights

## 21 February 2023

- Reviewed Ch. 3 methodology, preparing answers to these questions (I mostly wrote these):
  - Describe what I mean by ensemble modelling
  - What are the various approaches to ensemble modelling?
  - What are the outcomes for each ensemble modelling method? What do these outcomes mean in the context of model uncertainty?
  - Which ensemble modelling approach is most appropriate for climate models given uncertainty in model structure, initial conditions, and RCP scenarios?
  - What do I mean by "single climate model" in my proposed methods?
  - Does the definition of "single climate model" that I use impact model misspecification? In what ways?
  - What ARE the consequences of model misspecification associated with selecting a "single climate model" for assessments and forecasts? (since I am trying to mitigate those consequences)
    - What are the disadvantages of the "single assessment model paradigm" vs. avantages of ensemble models?
    - How will I even KNOW that the benefits of ensemble modelling outweight the disadvantages posed by ensemble modelling?
    - What are the "signs" I should look for in my performance metrics?
    - What are the management objectives that these metrics are measuring? How much influence does the management objective design have on the performance of the ensemble modelling methods?

## 20 February 2023

- Created a schedule for the rest of the WIN quarter for meeting my Monthly goals
- Technically a UW holiday today--but did quite a bit to set up to hit the ground running tomorrow  

## 16 February 2023

- Met with AEP to discuss my Ch. 1 question
- Now I will use the average catch for the five previous years to "initialize" the ABC I need from the last management period

## 15 February 2023

- ran 1 simulation using status quo harvest control rule, run 1 simulation using phase-in HCR
- created table in Excel comparing the ABCs for each harvest control rule
  - total catch should be the same
  - how that total catch is distributed should change--did the catch linearly increase or decrease when using phase-in? If yes, good!
- discovered a new question/problem for tomorrow: what is the best way to simulate the ABC from the last management period...for the first simulated management period.
  - tomorrow, I'll just have a status quo assessment go first and then have the phase-in HCR turn on for the next assessment.
- tackled so many email demons today (so many)

## 14 February 2023

- participated in weekly accountability group writing/coding session (Chapter 1)
- revised Ch. 1 phase-in harvest control rule protocol for implementation into ratpackmse software
- implemented new protocol into ratpackmse 

**Happy Valentine's Day**

## 13 February 2023

- travel day (~3 hours waiting for a gate at SEATAC, what a time to be alive)
- studied for General Exam (Population Dynamics section)
- added Masters research summary pages to personal website
- added Towards best practices in selex paper to personal website

## 10 February 2023

- met with weekly accountability group to conduct a retrospective for this week's work and to establish priorities for next week's work
- created a quarto version of my personal website
- created a research notebook section of the website
    - inspired by [Steven Roberts](https://sr320.github.io/)'s lab practices (particularly the work of [Chris Mantegna](https://chrismantegna.github.io/) and [Sarah Tanja](https://sarahtanja.github.io/lab-book/))
